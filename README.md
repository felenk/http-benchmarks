# http-benchmarks

This is a small set of ad-hoc, minimalistic tests for various stacks and web frameworks. 

Most of them are little more than `Hello World` web servers, just to get a baseline understanding of how each language runtime deals with socket handling, or (for some fraweworks) how they deal with routing.

## Stacks

### Go

* [`gearbox`](https://github.com/abahmed/gearbox)

### [Janet](https://janet-lang.org)

* [`circlet`](https://github.com/janet-lang/circlet)
* [`joy`](https://github.com/joy-framework/joy)

### Python

* [`bjoern`](https://github.com/jonashaag/bjoern)
